# Triangles.

The simplest thing in open gl. This directory shows you how to do it in four steps:

1. `triangle1` just draws a triangle on the screen.
2. `triangle2` uses vertex colour attributes to make it pretty.
3. `triangle3` moves the triangle around when you click.
4. `triangle4` puts a simple texture on the triangle.
