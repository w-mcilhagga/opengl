# opengl
God I hate open gl. It's like getting a Ferrari for free but discovering you have to build the damn thing yourself.

Anyway, this repo lists a whole bunch of open gl learner programs in Python (using `pyglet` and `pyshaders`) that do it in small steps.

If you are reading this, and know zip about open gl (but do know python), start with the triangles directory.
